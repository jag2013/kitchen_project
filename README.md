Unreal Version: 4.15.3

Headset: Oculus Rift

Detailed description of the design of experience and timer: I tried to make it as difficult as possible for the person playing the game to actually wash the dishes. I included fun and whimsical background music and a lot of audio to enhance the immersiveness of the experienced. The timer is simply two integer variables (1 for min, and 1 for seconds) set to the event tick. The timer is then placed in the scene to make it resemble the timer on the oven to the user's left side.

Explanation of the user's controls of experience: I gave the user big balloon hands so the user would be just as likely to break the dishes as wash them. It's fun. I hope you like it.

# Unreal Engine 4 VR Intro Starter Project READ ME

This project is part of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com "Udacity - Be in demand")'s [Unreal Engine 4 VR Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com)

This project is your first chance to make a game within Unreal Engine 4 for either standing or room-scale VR. You’ll need to utilize motion controllers to build a kitchen-themed interaction game, and you’ll use functions, physics, blueprint communication, and audio to create an immersive experience. Spawn messy dishes and get them into the sink as quickly as possible!
